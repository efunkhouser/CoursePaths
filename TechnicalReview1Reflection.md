Technical Review 1 Reflection

Feedback and Decisions:

During this review, we were able to elicit feedback from our peers on a few of the logistical difficulties we have encountered in our project thus far. We first seeked advice on how to deal with courses that are not offered on a regular schedule such as special topics courses and those that are only taught by one particular professor who may be on leave. We received a few possible solutions to this problem from our classmates.
â€˜
Instead of recommending specific courses to take, our program could simply suggest what type of courses to take in a given semester.
Perhaps it could recommend specific courses for the upcoming semester and general areas for all semesters further out.
The program could provide multiple options for each course it suggests in case the best case course is not offered.
The user could have the ability to move around suggested courses to other semesters if they know a course will or will not be offered at a certain time.

From this feedback we have decided to (at least initially) generalize the program to only recommend specific classes if they are a degree requirement and simply suggest taking a course in a particular area for all elective credits. 

Next we elicited feedback on what criteria would be most useful and relevant to incorporate into the course recommendation algorithm beyond difficulty of the course, suggested semester, and coloring balance (number of ENG, AHSE!, Math/Science credits). 

Some of our classmates expressed concerns that the difficulty criteria is too subjective and may differ from student to students, they also felt that having this measure would highlight the fact that some courses are perhaps to many or too few credits based on the amount of work they entail, which they felt would not be beneficial. Overall, many students agreed that the difficulty criteria was not the most important aspect to focus on for the recommendation algorithm. It was suggested that instead of focusing on the difficulty of the course, courses could be differentiated into those that are team project heavy and those that require more individual work as a balance between these two types of classes can make for a much more manageable semester. We received feedback that the suggested semester was an especially useful criteria as many students, especially those still early in their Olin careers, have a lot of classes to take and not a good sense of when would be the best time to take them. 

Based on this feedback, we are still determining what to include in the recommendation algorithm and will need to investigate this further. Due to time restrictions, we were not able to ask for suggestions on the best ways to input and display data and we will need to consider this more as our project progresses. 

Review Process Reflection:

Overall, the review went well and was very helpful. As all Olin students are familiar with the course planning process, we did not have to give an abundance of background information. We were able to move quickly through our presentation and spend the majority of the time on questions and discussion as we had planned to do in our agenda, however we did not do a great job of moving the discussion forward to address all of our questions in the time allotted. For future reviews, we should plan roughly how much time we would like to spend on each question and also present them in order of priority so that we can get as much valuable feedback as possible.
