The main focus of this review was to determine how we wish to proceed with the user-interaction portion of the program.
This was centered around a co-design in which the groups we were presenting to designed what they thought the final product should be.
We believe that had enough context to do this co-design, we showed them what was currently implemented and them gave them a couple of
possible ideas for further implementations. They gave us many possible ideas that we are still deciding between, and there are many
overlaps between each of the ideas. Because we only had this one focus, it was fairly easy to stick with the agenda
we set out with; however, we were a bit rushed during the co-design so perhaps we should have left out some of the information that we
presented.

Moving forward, we plan to implement a graphical representation of the results so that they will be more easily understood by a user.
we will do this with the assistance of the co-designs from the technical review. We still need to determine exactly how we will do this,
which library is best suited for our purposes and how we use that library.

A big benefit of the co-design was that most of the visualizations for the course plan were basically the same - a box for each semester comtaining its classes, maybe with color or size coding to show difficulty or type of class. This narrows down our design space and gives us a very specific type of graphic that we can look for from a library.

Reflecting on the feedback with regards to what our algorithm should consider drove home that course selection is immensely complicated even in the best cases, and that we may need to better define whether we want our program to do an OK job generating a course plan or do a perfect job telling the user, for example, how many requirements they have left and whether they have time to change majors.
