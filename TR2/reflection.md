The main focus of this review was to determine how we wish to proceed with the user-interaction portion of the program.
This was centered around a co-design in which the groups we were presenting to designed what they thought the final product should be.
We believe that had enough context to do this co-design, we showed them what was currently implemented and them gave them a couple of
possible ideas for further implementations. They gave us many possible ideas that we are still deciding between, and there are many
overlaps between each of the ideas. Because we only had this one focus, it was fairly easy to stick with the agenda
we set out with; however, we were a bit rushed during the co-design so perhaps we should have left out some of the information that we
presented.

Moving forward, we plan to implement a graphical representation of the results so that they will be more easily understood by a user.
we will do this with the assistance of the co-designs from the technical review. We still need to determine exactly how we will do this,
which library is best suited for our purposes and how we use that library.
